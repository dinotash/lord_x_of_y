# Lord X of Y

This interactive map shows the geographical distribution of the House of Lords, based on members' territorial titles.

Unlike MPs, Peers are not elected to represent particular constituences. However, their titles may reflect where their political and cultural sympathies lie when they decide how to vote.

The list of members of the House of Lords was taken from TheyWorkForYou, including voting records and party affiliations. This was supplemented with further research.

Peers' profiles are taken from the first paragraph of their wikipedia pages.

Territorial designations were mapped to latitude/longitude using the Google Maps API. Where more than one Lord would occupy the same grid square, they have been spread out to the nearest available spaces. This may have produced errors, especially around the big cities.

Peers were then shown on the map as close as possible to their territorial domain, without overlapping. Peers were assigned locations in roughly alphabetical order, which leads to some strange results, especially around London.

All data as at 9 April 2015.
